# ReactiveMedia

This is the core set of scripts for Unity that enable an attention-based system of reactive objects which in turn can drive implicit, adaptive changes in games and other interactive experiences.

The releases page contains .unitypackages that make it easier to install in Unity.

Feedback appreciated.

This is a PhD research project. More info to follow.
